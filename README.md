## Inspiration
1. When developing metaverse applications,  making 3D models takes a lot of time==. 
2. Many creators can use other creators' models to shorten the creation time.
3. Many models can be directly cast into NFTs and collected by his fans.
4. When the model is a large file, it will take a long time to download.
So. we hope to create the world’s largest valuable metadata marketplace for web3  in the future.

## What it does

1. Decentralized. All metadata is stored in Filecoin.
1.  MetadataSpace will shorten the time to make models through AI technology in the future。
2. Creators can easily buy the metaverse material they need in the marketplace.
3.  All metaverse material  can be minted into NFTs . MetadataSpace will also provide the function of one-click casting in the future.
4.  MetadataSpace will use Saturn which is a Filecoin retrieval network, to speed up the download of large files.

## How we built it

* Filecoin.  We store all metadata material in Filecoin  by using "web3.storage".
* Solidity.   We implement the  smart contracts with Solidity.
* MetaMask.  We  implement the decentralized applications  with MetaMask.
* React.  We developed the front end using React。
* AI,   We will develop AI-assisted authoring tools in the future.
* NFT, All metadata material can be minted into NFTs . We will also provide the function of one-click casting NFTs in the future.

## Challenges we ran into
1.  How to build a suitable smart contract. It can ensure that the transactions between creators can proceed smoothly

2. How to solve the problem that files are downloaded quickly.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
MetadataSpace can help the majority of creators save time when creating works，which is built in a decentralized way.

## What we learned
* How to use web3.storage and how it works.
* How to use AI technology to assist creation.
* How to develop smart contracts.
* How to use cryptocurrency wallet in decentralized application.


## What's next for MetadataSpace
* Firstly, we will develop AI-assisted authoring tools and Improve UI and interaction flow.
* Secondly, we will support more kinds of materials and support the search function.
* Thirdly, we will support the extremely fast download function of large-size files with the development of the Filecoin retrieval network.
